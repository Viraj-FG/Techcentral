        <h2>Amazon Associates Program</h2>
        <p>KAEVA (kaeva.app) is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>When you click on product links on this site and make a purchase on Amazon, we may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you. These commissions help us keep the site running, research new products, and create helpful content.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>We only recommend products we genuinely believe are worth your consideration. Our product selections are based on research, reviews, ratings, and real-world performance — not on commission rates. We strive to provide accurate, honest, and helpful information.</p>

        <h2>Product Information</h2>
        <p>Product prices and availability are accurate as of the date/time indicated and are subject to change. Any price and availability information displayed at the time of purchase on Amazon will apply to the purchase of the product.</p>
