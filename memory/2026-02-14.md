### Kaeva Deepfake Detection Project
- Discussed building Kaeva Deepfake Detection & Claim Validation System.
- Covered architecture, intent detection for customer-uploaded reels, business strategy/monetization.
- Spawned a sub-agent to draft a 100-page technical document (outline completed).
- User wants to use Claude 4.6 and Kimi models for development.

### Amazon Marketing Project (Amazon-Marketing repo)
- Built full repo from scratch at `C:\Users\12066\.openclaw\workspace-wolfie\Amazon-Marketing`.
- User is an Amazon Associate seller wanting to automate affiliate marketing.
- **Full pipeline built (16+ files, 4 git commits):**
  - `src/scraper.py` — Scrapes Amazon product data (title, price, rating, features, image)
  - `src/content_gen.py` — AI content generation (now via ai_provider, not direct OpenAI)
  - `src/poster.py` — Multi-platform poster (Reddit via PRAW, Twitter/X via Tweepy, WordPress via REST API)
  - `src/tracker.py` — Tracks posted links, prevents duplicates, logs activity
  - `src/main.py` — Entry point orchestrating the full pipeline
  - `src/ai_provider.py` — **Unified AI interface**: Ollama (free, local) → OpenAI (paid fallback)
  - `src/reddit_monitor.py` — Scans 15 subreddits every 5 min for keyword matches, sends WhatsApp alerts
  - `src/blog_generator.py` — Full SEO article + social snippet generation
  - `src/content_pump.py` — Generates **15 content types per product** (blog review, short post, comparison, buyer's guide, top 10 reasons, Twitter thread, Instagram captions, TikTok scripts, YouTube script, newsletter, Reddit comments, Quora answers, Pinterest, Facebook, deal alerts)
  - Dockerized with `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` (4 services: content-engine, blog-generator, content-pump, reddit-monitor)
  - `.env.example` for API keys, `links.txt` for user input, `watch_config.json` for Reddit monitoring
- **AI backend switched to Ollama (free local models)** — default model `llama3.1:8b`, OpenAI as optional fallback
- Installed Ollama models: Llama 3.1 8B (4.9GB), Mistral 7B (4.4GB), Gemma3 4B, Kimi K2.5
- First affiliate product loaded: **Apple 2024 Mac mini M4 — $729** (`https://amzn.to/4kFdSh6`)
- Crafted 5 Reddit reply templates for active Mac mini threads
- Searched Reddit for active Mac mini buying threads (r/macmini, r/mac, r/MiniPCs)
- **Reddit bot does NOT auto-post** — sends alerts to user who posts manually (TOS compliance)
- User wants "maximum content volume" — pump as much content as possible

### Reddit & X Account Setup (Late Session)
- User asked me to create Reddit and X/Twitter accounts for them using Browser Relay
- **I declined** — these platforms require email/phone verification, CAPTCHA, and personal TOS agreement; must be done by the user themselves
- Gave step-by-step instructions for both:
  - Reddit: Sign up → go to reddit.com/prefs/apps → create "script" app → get Client ID + Secret
  - X/Twitter: Sign up → developer.x.com → apply for developer access → get API keys
- **Still awaiting**: Reddit API credentials and X API keys to activate the system

### WhatsApp Integration
- Connected Wolfie agent to WhatsApp successfully.
- Initial message delivery had delays but eventually worked.
- WhatsApp gateway briefly disconnected (status 408) around 9:32 AM but reconnected.
- User's WhatsApp number: +2063765245.

### Technical Notes
- PowerShell does not support `&&` chaining — use `;` instead.
- `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` works for deleting directories with `.git`.
- Installed `pandoc` via `winget` for document conversion.
- Brave Search API rate-limited on free plan (1 req/s, 2000 quota).

### API Credentials Obtained
- **X/Twitter Developer Account**: Set up on console.x.com
  - Account: @Viraj_Sharma_05
  - App: 2022789109845233665 / Viraj_Sharm (Pay Per Use tier)
  - All keys generated and saved to `Amazon-Marketing/.env`: Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret, Bearer Token
  - Note: X API is pay-per-use now, $0 balance — posting may require credits
- **Reddit Account**: Calm-Cow250
  - App creation attempted on old.reddit.com/prefs/apps — CAPTCHA blocking automated submission
  - Still needs: user to solve CAPTCHA and click "create app" on old.reddit.com/prefs/apps (form is pre-filled)
  - Reddit Client ID + Secret still needed for `.env`

### Next Steps
1. User solves CAPTCHA on Reddit app creation page → get Client ID + Secret → update `.env`
2. User needs to set Reddit password in `.env` (REDDIT_PASSWORD field)
3. Add more affiliate links to `links.txt` → run content pump
4. Optionally set up WordPress blog for SEO long game
5. Push repo to GitHub remote
6. Note: X API is pay-per-use — may need credits to post
