# 2026-02-15 — Session Notes

## GitHub Push — Completed
- Created GitHub repo via browser: **github.com/Viraj-FG/Amazon-Marketing** (Public)
- GitHub username: **Viraj-FG** (also has org "Raspbaby-Inc")
- Git credential manager is configured and works — pushed via HTTPS without manual token
- `gh` CLI v2.86.0 installed via winget but never authenticated (device code flow kept expiring)
- All 5 commits pushed to `main` branch successfully
- `.env` is gitignored (safe — contains X API keys)

## Content Pump Sub-Agent — Failed
- Spawned sub-agent with Kimi K2.5 thinking model to run content pump on 8 products
- Sub-agent went off-script: instead of running `content_pump.py`, it created new bot scripts:
  - `researcher_bot.py`, `test_researcher_bot.py`, `content_creator_bot.py`
  - `engagement_bot.py`, `relay_bot.py`, `messaging_integration.py`, `instagram_webhook.py`
  - Made 6 commits for these additions
- **No content was actually generated** — `content_output/` directory doesn't exist
- Lesson: sub-agents need more constrained instructions; "run this script" not "work on this project"

## Kimi K2.5 via Ollama
- `kimi-k2.5:cloud` is listed in Ollama but hangs/doesn't respond when tested
- Direct `ollama run kimi-k2.5:cloud` timed out after 30+ seconds with no output
- For content generation, should fall back to `llama3.1:8b` (local, reliable)

## Kaeva Project
- Hourly reminder still firing ("Update the user on Kaeva project progress")
- Should probably disable this reminder — project is dormant/planning phase
- Status unchanged: 100-page technical doc outline drafted by sub-agent previously

## Git Config
- Had to add safe.directory for Amazon-Marketing repo (ownership mismatch BUILTIN/Administrators vs user)
- `git config --global --add safe.directory C:/Users/12066/.openclaw/workspace-wolfie/Amazon-Marketing`

## Bunny Bot Agent Created
- User requested new agent "Bunny Bot" 🐰 to replace Wolfie on WhatsApp
- Model: Kimi K2.5 (kimi-coding/k2p5)
- Agent ID: `bunny-bot`
- Agent dir: `C:\Users\12066\.openclaw\agents\bunny-bot\agent`
- Workspace: `C:\Users\12066\.openclaw\workspace-bunny-bot`
- Created files: SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md
- WhatsApp binding changed: `wolfie` → `bunny-bot`
- Wolfie is still available on webchat, just no longer bound to WhatsApp
- Gateway restarted successfully at ~5:59 PM PST

## Session Context
- User said "Hi" at 5:54 PM Sunday — brief check-in
- Gave status update on GitHub push (done), content pump (failed), pending items
- Still pending: Reddit CAPTCHA, content pump run, X API credits
- User asked to configure new agent "Bunny Bot" on WhatsApp — completed
